            <h3>Vehicle Counting From Video Stream </h3>
            <p>A CCTV camera is a critical component of an intelligent traffic surveillance framework. It is simply an
                automated process that monitors traffic in a specific area and detects vehicles for further action. The
                captured images can provide valuable clues to cops and other public essential tracking ser- vices, such
                as the vehicle’s licence plate number, time and motion of the vehicle, details associated with the
                driver, and so on, all of which can lead to evidences of a crime or any unforeseen or unfortunate
                incidents. Previ- ously, images were manually processed. In fact, this system is still in use in India,
                while countries such as Saudi Arabia have implemented automated machines CCTVs that operate 24 hours a
                day, seven days a week and take immediate action via signalling.Human error and other factors that
                impact live beings have long made manual labour slower and less effective. Many creative thinkers have
                created specific intelligent traffic while keeping these things in mind and evolving with technology.
                University of North Bengal is anticipated to benefit from the finished project.</p>
